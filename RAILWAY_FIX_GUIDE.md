# üîß Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed:

I've resolved the "No active deployment" error by adding proper Railway configuration files:

### 1. **Added Procfile**
```
web: node server.js
```

### 2. **Updated railway.toml**
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

### 3. **Added nixpacks.toml**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs", "npm"]

[phases.install]
cmd = "npm ci"

[phases.build]
cmd = "echo 'No build step required'"

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

## üöÄ Redeploy Steps:

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy (Recommended)
1. **Railway should auto-detect** the new commits and redeploy
2. **Check your Railway dashboard** - it should show "Deploying..."
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. **Go to Railway dashboard**
2. **Click your project**
3. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
4. **Click "Deploy Latest"** or "Redeploy"

### Option 3: Fresh Deploy
If still having issues:
1. **Delete the current Railway project**
2. **Create new project**
3. **Deploy from GitHub**: `locle27/nearbyspots-qr`

## üîç After Deployment:

### 1. Set Environment Variables
```bash
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyAVdAZdO0tjOSoNImELNfi5HtZVzitN3Y4
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://YOUR_RAILWAY_DOMAIN.railway.app
```

### 2. Test Deployment
Visit: `https://YOUR_RAILWAY_DOMAIN.railway.app/api/health`

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-13T...",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 3. Update CORS_ORIGIN
After you get your Railway domain, update the `CORS_ORIGIN` variable with the actual domain.

## üêõ If Still Having Issues:

### Check Railway Logs:
1. **Go to Railway dashboard**
2. **Click your project**
3. **Go to "Logs" tab**
4. **Look for error messages**

### Common Solutions:
- **Port Issue**: Railway automatically assigns PORT
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies are in package.json
- **Start Command**: Now explicitly set to "npm start"
- **Build Process**: Configured via nixpacks.toml

## ‚úÖ Local Testing Confirmed:
- ‚úÖ Server starts successfully
- ‚úÖ Google Maps API configured
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ No build errors

Your app should now deploy successfully! üéâ
