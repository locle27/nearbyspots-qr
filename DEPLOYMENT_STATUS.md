# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix - Status Update

## ❌ **Original Error:**
```
error: undefined variable 'npm'
at /app/.nixpacks/nixpkgs-ffeebf0acf3ae8b29f8c7049cd911b9636efd7e7.nix:19:16
```

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Removed nixpacks.toml**
- The custom Nixpacks configuration was causing conflicts
- Railway's auto-detection works better for Node.js projects

### 2. **Simplified railway.toml**
- Removed builder specification
- Kept only essential deployment settings
- Let Railway use default Node.js detection

### 3. **Fixed Node.js Version**
- Changed from `>=18.0.0` to `18.x`
- More compatible with Railway's environment

### 4. **Added .railwayignore**
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Reduces build size and potential conflicts

## 🚀 **Current Configuration:**

### package.json (engines)
```json
"engines": {
  "node": "18.x"
}
```

### railway.toml
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

### Procfile
```
web: node server.js
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Railway should auto-redeploy** with the new configuration
2. **Check Railway logs** for deployment progress
3. **If deployment succeeds**, add environment variables:
   ```
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyAVdAZdO0tjOSoNImELNfi5HtZVzitN3Y4
   NODE_ENV=production
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.railway.app
   ```

## 🔍 **Monitoring:**

- **Watch Railway dashboard** for deployment status
- **Check build logs** if issues persist
- **Test health endpoint**: `/api/health`

## 🆘 **If Still Failing:**

### Alternative Approach:
1. **Delete current Railway project**
2. **Create new Railway project**
3. **Use "Deploy from GitHub"** option
4. **Select**: `locle27/nearbyspots-qr`
5. **Let Railway auto-configure** everything

Railway should now successfully detect this as a Node.js project and deploy automatically! 🚀
